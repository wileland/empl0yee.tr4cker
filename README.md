### User Story
As a business owner,  
I want to manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company effectively  
so that I can organize and plan my business efficiently.

### Acceptance Criteria
Given a command-line application that accepts user input,

When I start the application,  
then I am presented with options to view all departments, roles, and employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role.

When I choose to view all departments,  
then I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department IDs.

When I choose to view all roles,  
then I am presented with a formatted table showing the job title, role ID, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role.

When I choose to view all employees,  
then I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee IDs, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to.

When I choose to add a department,  
then I am prompted to enter the name of the department, and that department is added to the database.

When I choose to add a role,  
then I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role, and that role is added to the database.

When I choose to add an employee,  
then I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database.

When I choose to update an employee role,  
then I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role, and this information is updated in the database.
